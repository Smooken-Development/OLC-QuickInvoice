Hello!

This is once more a program for automating some of the administrative tasks at the Online Learning Center at NMSU-A.
This program is specifically for the person who handles invoices and payment of the reviewers working on the
biannual cohort reviews. I got tired of having to constantly do all of this by hand, so I went out of my way to begin
building a small little tool to help me automate some of the more menial and time-consuming tasks.

This app specifically is to help make documents for reviewers. I notice that I tend to fall behind on invoices almost
solely because of how long it takes to make them all, and then send them out. With this tool, it shoudl help speed
things up almost immidiately. Just choose a file location to save to, and begin filling out the required fields. The 
fields marked with a '*' symbol are required for the app to make the invoices. Everything else can remain blank. After
you fill out all the required fields, double-check to make sure everything is filled out correctly, then press the
process document button. It will then save a new PDF for you to send out to reviewers!

If you have any issues with this program, please feel free to email me at 'ZacAC2024@outlook.com' for software help.
If you would like to comission me for an automation task, send me a quick email including all of your contact info
and a brief description of your request I will get back to you as soon as I can.

Sincerely,

Zac
